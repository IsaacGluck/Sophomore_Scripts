		<h2> Music </h2>
		<p> Music has been a large part of my life ever since I was a young lad. At the young age of 3, I was enrolled in the <a href="http://www.suzukiprogram.com/"> Suzuki</a> violin program. I rose through the ranks of Suzuki, playing hard and practicing digilently every day for 9 years. Suzuki however, did not last for ever and when I was 12 I moved on to private lessons with private teachers where I had more freedom to experiment and grow as a violinist.</p><p> At the age of 14 I began teaching myself guitar, a hobby that I have kept up and that has helped my musical ability tremedously. </p></div>

		<h2> Sports </h2>
		<p>Like, music, sports have also always been a large part of my life. From when I was a little kid, my dad would take me to the park to play a variety of sports from soccer, to football, to basketball. The sport that stuck however was soccer. Over the years I played in West Side Soccer League(<a href="http://www.wssl.org/">WSSL</a>) but as I got older I moved onto Manhattan Soccer Club (<a href="http://manhattansc.org/">MSC</a>), a travel soccer club. Here I played on some of the best premiere teams in the state. Last year however (2011), life threw me a curve ball as I injured my back seriously. Whether or not I will need surgery is still unkown but I have not been active for over a year and I will likely never play at the premiere level again. The initial effect of this loss was devestating, however, I quickly realized that I was never going to play proffesionaly, I had to stop at some point. This tragedy also lead to a large free up of my time which allowed me to focus on other important aspects of my life like music and school. </p></div>

		<h2> School </h2>
		<p>My real school experience began in elementary school when I attended the Alfred E. Smith School (<a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M163/default.htm">P.S. 163 </a>) In 5th grade I was accepted into the DELTA program at <a href="http://www.ms54.org/">M.S. 54 </a>. Finally, in 8th grade I was accepted to <a href="http://stuy.enschool.org/">Stuyvesant Highschool </a> where I am currently enrolled. Throughout school I have never really had a favorite subject, it has really depended on the teacher.  Whenever I have a charismatic, intelligent and caring teacher, the subject they teach becomes my favorite while I'm in their class. Recently however, if I had to choose a subject I would lean towards either Biology, Chemistry or Computer Science. Throughout middle and highschool I have participated in many clubs and teams. In middle school, I was point guard on the Booker T. Raiders (the basketball team) as well as a part of the Model UN club. In high school, I was on the soccer team, the track team, and a part of the Model UN club and <a href="http://stuyspectator.com/">The Spectator </a> (the school newspaper). Currently I am the executive producer of SING!, the inter-grade competition to put on a killer musical/show in a month time. Every club I have been in as well as every school I have attended have helped me to learn and grow.</p></div>
